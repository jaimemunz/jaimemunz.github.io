### Past Week
This past week, we started going over patterns. Some patters and the abstract factory pattern, the singleton pattern and teh creational pattern. We also finished the final project, which was the last phase of the project we have been working on. All that is left to do is present and we will be done with it.

### What is in my way
The only big thing for this week is my database project. There were some due dates moved and now project 6 is due at the same time as the final project. This is due next Monday, so it looks like we will be working on the project tomorrow and on Wednesday. Besides taht project, it looks like I only have some assignments to do for chemistry and next week will be test week. 

### Next Week
We will prepare for our project presentation on Thursday and I will try to start reviewing some of the previous lectures for the exam that is happening Next Thursday. Besides that, it is just finishing strong for this and my other classes and then finals.

### Tip of the Week
If you are a minority in CS, Microsoft and Google are giving out scholarships to help you attend the Tapia Conference next year in Atlanta. This is a great networking opportunity and you get to learn about diversity in tech. The Microsoft scholarship closes this Thursday and the Google scholarship closes on June 28th.
