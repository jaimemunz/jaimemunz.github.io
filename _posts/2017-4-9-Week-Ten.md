### Past Week
This past week we finished IDB2. I worked on the backend creating the instance and inserting values into the table. In class, we were learning about sql and started working on refractoring. 

### What is in my way
I have a chemistry test which I have been studying for but don't feel too confident about yet, so a large part of my week will be devoted to that. Besides that, I have a project due for data management which should not take too long. In architecture I have a paper due. 

### Next Week
We will be getting the next phase of the project this week so we will be reading the spects and desciding who does what. Besidse that, I should start reviewing some of the previous topics from class. 

### Tip of the Week
I just recently discovered that we get a free copy of Office 360. I needed to make a presentation and it came in useful since google slides didn't have a functionality I needed.
