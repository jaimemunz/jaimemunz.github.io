### Past Week
This past week was the first week back in school. This means a lot of planning and organizing like putting dates in calendars and figuring out a good routine. In SWE we learned about the coming collatz project and how to create unit tests. 

### What is in my way
Last year I founded the Hispanic Association for Computer Scientists and it is a bit of a time commitment. I hope that by staying on top of my school work and dealing with tasks in a timely fashion it won't be so bad though. Besides, I really care about this organization so I'll figure it out!

### Tip of the Week
My advice would be to put the due dates for your courses all in one place. This helps you see what weeks are going to be more demanding and plan accordingly. It also gives you a good layout so you are not taken by surpise when a big tests pops up. My softwre of choice is google calendar, but I am sure there are several good ones!
