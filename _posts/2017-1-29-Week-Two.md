### Past Week
This past week we have continued learing about python. We learned that everything in python inherits from another class and has a type. We also started learning about lists and tuples. I have set up everything for the project, just need to optimize it with a cache and I will be done. 

### What is in my way
This weekend was not very productive, so I am a bit behind with some of my readings but I hope to catch up with relative ease. The week ahead looks pretty clear, except for an event on Tuesday, so I should be able to get a lot of stuff done. I am also taking data management and have a project due in that class as well. 

### Tip of the Week
Since career fair is coming up, if you think you need more practice with your technical coding interview skills, the Hispanic Association of Computer Scientists is going to host an event where Facebook engineers come and give you some pointers. They will have mock interviews and you can get a chance to ask any burning questions you may have. So if you feel like this could be useful for you, the event will take place at 5:30 on Tueday in GDC 1.304.
