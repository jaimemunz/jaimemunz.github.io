### Past Week
This past week we continued learning about generators and we started learning about iterables. My partner and I set up the repo for the second project. I also had a chemistry test on Thursday, and it cause me to not be able to put as much time as I would have liked into the project.

### What is in my way
Career fair is on Tuesday and I have two projects due this week. I have been productive this weekend though, so I get to focus more on the projects and not so much on the readings. Career fair will be a bit more relaxed for me this time around. I already have something lined up, but I would still like to go talk to recruiters about the opportunities they have for the coming semester, when I will be looking for a full time positions. 

### Next Week
It seems like we won't get much time to work on the project until Wednesday, so I will try to finish my database project before that. Project two seems relatively straight forward, but it can still take a lot of time so getting as much of it done on Wednesday will be what we will be shooting for. 

### Tip of the Week
A lot of start ups don't go to career fair but are still willing to take interns for the summer. You can look them up online and shoot them a message so don't be discouraged if career fair doesn't go your way.
