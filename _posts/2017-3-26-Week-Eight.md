### Past Week
This past week I worked on the project with my group. I was in charge of getting the data and setting up aws. All things considered, it went very smooth and we managed to finish the project on time. I was using some of these tools for the first time so it took me a while to know how they worked but it went smoothly otherwise. In class we have started learning about xlm.

### What is in my way
I only have one test on Tuesday. Besides that, I think we can start working on the next project to get an early start. 

### Next Week
The week is looking pretty relaxed, so our group could begin to know the requirements and who is going to be doing what. I will continue to do the readings. Other than that is just the regular assignments in my other classes, and another ongoing project for database management.

### Tip of the Week
If you are working on an android app or are interested in keeping up with android news, [Android Weekly](http://androidweekly.net/) has really good resources that they compile in an email and update you on weekly. The news are very varied so I can usually find something interesting.
