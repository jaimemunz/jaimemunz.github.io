### Print Sources

My first print source is Planet Niemeyer, which is cited as a source from a magazine later in this blog. 

My second print source is Simone Neiva's article titled "Museum of Contemporary Art of Niteroi: Lightness Molded in Concrete." This article talks about Oscar Niemeyer's use of traditional materials to create modern buildings. The author argues that it is not entirely necessary to for architects to rely soley on plastic to give buildings the feeling of lightednesss. Oscar Niemeyer is said to cleverly use the shape and structure of buildings to give this desired effect, and that one would not immediately realize that the Niteroi Museum of Contemporary Art is made entirely of concrete and glass. Oscar Niemeyer uses curves, color, and glass in ways few other architects are able to do and this makes him one of the most important architects of the 20th Century. [3]
