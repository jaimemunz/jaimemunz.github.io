### Print Sources

My first print source is Planet Niemeyer, which is cited as a source from a magazine later in this blog. 

My second print source is Simone Neiva's article titled "Museum of Contemporary Art of Niteroi: Lightness Molded in Concrete." This article talks about Oscar Niemeyer's use of traditional materials to create modern buildings. The author argues that it is not entirely necessary to for architects to rely soley on plastic to give buildings the feeling of lightness. Oscar Niemeyer is said to cleverly use the shape and structure of buildings to give this desired effect, and that one would not immediately realize that the Niteroi Museum of Contemporary Art is made entirely of concrete and glass. Oscar Niemeyer uses curves, color, and glass in ways few other architects are able to do and this makes him one of the most important architects of the 20th Century. [3]

### My Drawing

A big inspirator for Niemeyer for the shape of the building was that of a flower. I tried to capture that in my (not so artistic) drawing. I wanted it to look like a flower growing on a cliff. It is what best describes the building's curves for me. 

### Interior

Inside MAC [4]. Although the exhibition is inside, it seems like Oscar Niemeyer wanted guest to fully appreciate the beautiful landscape. The glass windows all around the building help do this in a magnificent way.

### Google Map

Google Map [5].
The building lies in the edge of a cliff that juts out of the land and this means that the building is surrounded by water on most directions. The location may have influenced the shape of the building more than any other factor.

### Building Featured in Travel Video 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WQnxUpuS13U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this video you get to really appreciate the commitment to curve that Oscar Niemeyer displayed in his buildings. The bridge that leads you to the entrace has many turns, some of them forcing you to turn a full 360 degrees. It is as if Oscar Niemeyer is preparing you for the real view that you will be able to fully experience once you look out from inside the building. [7]

### Flickr photo cache 

There are many details that catch my eye when looking at the photo cache for this building. The first one is the reflecting pool beneath the building. It really helps make the building look like a flower, which is where some of the inspiration for the shape of the building came from. Another one is the way the building seems to float. The white paint, rounded surfaces, and glass windows give the feeling of lightness to this building. 

### Website featuring my building

In the article titled "A look back at Oscar Niemeyer, master of curved concrete", the author Tim Maley expresses admiration for Oscar Miemeyer's use of concrete, claiming that they give his buildings a futuristic look. I completely agree with the author. Oscar Niemeyer's buildings have a fresh look to them, and even though he uses concrete, he does not use it in a way other architects do. Oscar Niemeyer is known for his love of curves, and he has perfected his form. While other buildings make use of right angles, his work is mostly with curves and it gives them a futuristic look that is hard to imitate. [8]

### Three Things I learned from a Journal about my Building

* While other buildings with a curved surface have difficulty displaying art because of the curvature of the walls, Niemeyer neatly solves this issue by creating an inner hexagonal-shaped core of space enclosed by flat screen walls.[1]
* The building is only one of many other buildings designed by Niemeyer in the bay of Niteroi, part of a "more ambitious urban redevelopment plan to revive the suburb's fortunes." [1]
* The use of verticall mullions contrasted with teh white carapace is used to magnify the scale and underscore the building's function as a civic landmark.[1]
