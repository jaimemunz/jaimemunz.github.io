### Past Week
This past week we presented our projects and extra credit. I think our group did really well and I am like the end result. I have learned a lot during this project. 

### What is in my way
All that is left now is the SWE project and a chemistry project. After my database presentation, I will be free to give all my time to these two things. If I take advantage of the time that I have I think I can do really well on these tests. 

### Next Week
I will be spending my time reviewing for my chemistry and SWE test. Besides this, my grade is pretty much set and I just need to do well on the exam to do well on the class. 

### Tip of the Week
It helps me a lot if I break up my task into smaller pieces. This is especially useful when studying for exams since I can see how all the different topics connect to one another.
