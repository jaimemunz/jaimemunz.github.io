### Past Week
This past week in class we have been learning about tables and managing data bases with SQL. I am currently taking a database management class so some of the topics are familiar. We have started working on the project and have assigned responsibilities to people. 

### What is in my way
There are several assignments for chemistry so I will need to stay on top of that. I would also like to start on the data management final so that those last weeks are a little bit more light. In my architecture class I have to do a presentation so I will need some time to practice the presentation. 

### Next Week
We need to finish phase two of the project. I am working on the back end but the database has been set up so we just need to brush up some of the data, create the tables, and insert the information in to the tables and connect it to the front end. 

### Tip of the Week
If you are looking for a place to practice coding questions I would suggest you look into hackerrank.com. They have a good varierity of questions for beginners or advanced users. Its a good way to practice for technical interviews or just have some fun if you are into doing coding questions for programming competitiosn.
