### Past Week
This past week we learned about types, operators, and variables. I also completed project one. I didn't think the project itself was too difficult, but even after having taken OOP last semester, getting used to the tools takes a while. We also have begun creating our own funtions in class. 

### What is in my way
There is a research paper for my architecture & society class. It has been a while since I have done research so this will be interesting. It doesn't look too diffficult, we just have to find our sources and present them in any format we choose. I will try to use my time wisely and getting the most out of every study session. I have also been assigned a lot of readings for my other classes, so keeping up with those is the hardest thing to do. 

### Next Week
I will try to get done with the source-finding assignment for my architecture class early so I can focus on my study classes. The hardest part is starting so I just need to find the motivation!

### Tip of the Week
If you are feeling tired between your classes, try taking a nap! UT has a Nap Map, which has good nap spots around campus. I have found this useful many times when I am out and about and I am not familiar with the buildings.
