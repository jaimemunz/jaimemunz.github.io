### Past Week
This past week we finished talking about refactoring. We then moved on to method overriding and we looked at some design patterns. We got the grades back for our previous project and we did well. I looked at the specs for the next project and it seems like the big thing is the search capabilities. 

### What is in my way
I have some things to do for HACS, and a architecture exam on Tuesday. For chemistry, we have started a new section so I would like to stay on top of my learning excersises. For database I have a quiz on Wednesday. 

### Next Week
We will work on the project and will most likely have it finished by Thursday. We are meeting to work on it tomorrow and will assign responsibilities then. The number of quizes left in this class is getting pretty low so it is also the last chances we will get to better our quiz scores.  

### Tip of the Week
Drink water. I have found that being hydragted helps keep me focused. It also makes me more awake so I am much more effective when I drink water. You should only drink it if you need to though. I found out that the need to drink a crazy amount of water is just a myth so listen to your body! I am running out of ideas for tips as you can probably tell.
