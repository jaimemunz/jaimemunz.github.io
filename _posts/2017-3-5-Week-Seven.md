### Past Week
This past week we had an exam. I thought it was pretty straight forward, though I should have studied the terms from the readings a bit more. On Thursday, we had a speaker from a mobile consulting company. He talked about what he did day to day and what we should do to make sure we are prepared for working in the field. 

### What is in my way
Chem exam coming up. I have been putting all my efforts on this exam, so I hope I do well. Besides that, me and my partner need to start looking for teammates for the future projects. We will start looking for them this week, probably through piazza. 

### Next Week
We will start looking for teammates for the future projects and maybe start. With spring break coming up, and my chemistry exam, I hope that I have time for other things. Besides looking for teammmates, I hope to start looking at the project, and maybe even start, though that is not likely. 

### Tip of the Week
My tip of the week would be to recommend using Evernote. It is a note taking app, and it has become like a second brain for me. It has a steep learning curve, but once you get familiar with it, you can't live without it. I use it mainly to get things out of my head. The less stuff I have to remember, the better attention I can pay to the things that matter. Google drive can serve the same purpose.
