### Past Week
This past week was we had a guest speaker from Bloomber that talked to us about what Blomber does, and what he does specifically. Although I didn't understand some of the things the speaker was talking about, I always enjoy hearing software developers talk about their projects and sound enthusiastic. On Thursday we started going over lamdas and classes in python. 

### What is in my way
An architecture exam on Tuesday and then my week looks pretty clear. My week looks a lot more relaxed than some of my classmates so I am grateful for that. I will try to stay on top of my readings and start studying for the software engineering exam so I ma not caught off-guard. 

### Next Week
I will start studying for the exam and go over some of the things that I still have trouble with. These quizzes are tough so I also need to go over the material after class to make sure I am understanding things correctly. 

### Tip of the Week
If you use vim but are not familiar with the shortcuts, like I was, you can use gvim in the lab machines. It is a gui for vim and it has various buttons for copying, pasting, and cutting. It is useful for someone who is just learning vim but it can be kind of a crutch, so you should also learn your shortcuts!
